This app allows a user to search and save recipes. Users can type or use the filters to search by ingredients.

### Tools

For this project I used Vite and Firebase.
Firebase is used to allow users to login and save a recipe, only users who are logged in can save and view saved recipes.

### APIs

This project uses SpoonacularAPI and theMealLabDB.
Spoonacular allows you to do more than theMealLabDB but for this project Spoonacular is only used for filtered searches.

### Using Vite

The dev command needs to be ran in order to get vite to deploy.
